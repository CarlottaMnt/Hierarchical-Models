# Stan-Hierarchical-Models
Stan codes for hierarchical regression models written in R.
Three hierarchical regression models with Normal, Poisson and Bernoulli likelihood distributions are implemented for estimating the regression intercept and slopes. 
The hierarchical structure allows to infer the regression parameters for several groups by partial pooling information among them.
Weakly informative hyper-prior distributions are used for all the three models.
